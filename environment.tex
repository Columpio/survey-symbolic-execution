\subsection{Interaction with the Environment}
\label{ss:environment}

Real-world applications constantly interact with the environment (e.g., the file system or the network) through libraries and system calls. These interactions may cause side-effects (e.g., file creation)
that could later affect the execution and must be therefore taken into account. Evaluating any possible interaction outcome is generally unfeasible: it could generate a large number of execution states, of which only a small number can actually happen in a non-symbolic scenario.

%A typical strategy is to consider popular library and system routines and create models that can help the symbolic engine analyze only significant outcomes.

A body of early works (e.g., {\sc DART}~\cite{DART-PLDI05},  {\sc CUTE}~\cite{CUTE-FSE13}, and {\sc EXE}~\cite{EXE-CCS06}) includes the environment in symbolic analysis by actually executing external calls using concrete arguments for them. This indeed limits the behaviors they can explore compared to a fully symbolic strategy, which on the other hand might be unfeasible.
%In an online executor this choice also results in having calls from distinct paths of execution interfere with each other.
This choice might also result in having calls from distinct paths of execution interfere with each other. 

Another way to tackle the problem is to create an abstract model that captures these interactions. For instance, in {\sc KLEE}~\cite{KLEE-OSDI08} symbolic files are supported through a basic {\em symbolic file system} for each execution state, consisting of a directory with $n$ symbolic files whose number and sizes are specified by the user. An operation on a symbolic file results in forking $n+1$ state branches: one for each possible file, plus an optional one to capture unexpected errors in the operation.
%As the number of functions in a standard library is typically large and writing models for them is expensive and error-prone~\cite{Ball06}, models are generally implemented at system call-level rather than library level. This enables the symbolic exploration of the libraries as well.

{\sc AEG}~\cite{AEG-NDSS11} models most of the system environment that could be used by an attacker as input source, including the file system, network sockets, and environment variables. Additionally, more than 70 library and system calls are emulated, including thread- and process-related system calls, and common formatting functions to capture potential buffer overflows. %Symbolic files are handled as in {\sc KLEE}~\cite{KLEE-OSDI08}, while symbolic sockets are dealt with in a similar manner, with packets and their payloads being processed as in symbolic files and their contents. {\sc Cloud9} further extends support to many other POSIX libraries, allowing users to also control advanced conditions in the testing environment. For instance, it can simulate reordering, delays, and packet dropping caused by a fragmented data stream over a network.

{\sc \stwoe}~\cite{CKC-TOCS12} remarks that models, other than expensive to write, rarely achieve full accuracy, and may quickly become stale if the modeled system changes. Hence, it would be preferable to let analyzed programs interact with the real environment while exploring multiple paths. In their \stwoe\ platform, the authors rely on virtualization to perform the desired analysis on the real software stack, preventing side effects from propagating across independent execution paths. 

%{\sc DART}'s approach~\cite{DART-PLDI05} is different, as the goal is to enable automated unit testing. DART deems as foreign interfaces all the external variables and functions referenced in a C program along with the arguments for a top-level function. External functions are simulated by nondeterministically returning any value of their specified return type. Library functions are normally not considered external functions as they are controlled by the program, but in practice the user can adjust the boundary between library and external functions to simulate the desired effects.
