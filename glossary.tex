\noindent {\bf Complete analysis.} Analysis that guarantees no false positives, i.e., all reported property violations are true.

\smallskip\noindent {\bf Control flow graph (CFG).} Representation of a program that uses nodes to model instructions and edges to model the control flow between them.

\smallskip\noindent {\bf Control flow path.} Path in the control flow graph of a program. Represents the sequence of instructions executed by the program for a given concrete input.

\smallskip\noindent {\bf SMT solver.} \ldots

\smallskip\noindent {\bf Sound analysis.} Analysis that guarantees no false negatives, i.e., if there is a property violation, then it is reported.
