\section{Path explosion}

One of the main challenges of symbolic execution is the path explosion problem. Since symbolic execution may fork off a new interpreter at every branch, the total number of interpreters may be exponential in the number of branches of the program. This impact both time and space, as a symbolic executor may need to keep track of an exponential number of pending branches to be explore. A common approach is to compute an under-approximation of the analysis that only explores a relevant subset of the state space.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Pruning unrealizable paths}

A common technique for reducing the path space is invoking the constraint solver at each branch, pruning branches that are not realizable. 

From warm-up example\mynote{IF: I removed from the warm up the non-forking case. Must be explained here}:

The evaluation of a conditional branch ${\tt if}~e~{\tt then}~s_{true}~{\tt else}~s_{false}$ affects the path constraint. Two scenarios are possible:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item {\em Non-forking}: if $e$ is evaluated as always true (resp., false) under the assumptions in the current state, the proper branch is taken and the symbolic execution advances to $s_{true}$ (resp., $s_{false}$);
      \item {\em Forking}: if $e$ cannot be evaluated without instantiating values for one or more of its symbols, the symbolic execution is forked by creating two execution states with path constraints $pct_{true}$ and $pct_{false}$, respectively, corresponding to the two {\tt if} branches. Namely, $pct_{true}=pct \wedge e_s$ and $pct_{false}=pct \wedge \neg e_s$, where $e_s$ is a symbolic expression obtained by evaluating $e$. 
%        \[ (s_{true}, pc_{true}) \text{ where } pc_{true} = pc \wedge e \]
%        \[ (s_{false}, pc_{false}) \text{ where } pc_{false} = pc \wedge \neg e \]
    Symbolic execution proceeds on both states in parallel.
    \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Bounding computational resources}
\label{heuristics}

Another common approach is to limit the amount of resources symbolic execution is allowed to use. For instance, the computation may time out after a certain amount of time. Since only a fraction of paths may be explored, the search should be prioritized by looking at the most promising paths first. There are several strategies for selecting the next path to be explored.
%\paragraph{Path selection (aka state scheduling)}
Table~\ref{tab:heuristics} provides a list of search heuristics that have been presented or discussed in prior works. Different heuristics can be used for deciding which execution state should be evaluated next:

\begin{itemize}

  \item \cite{AEG-NDSS11}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item {\em buggy-path-first}: priority to path that shown to contain errors (even if not exploitable)
    \item {\em loop exhaustion}: give priority to path that are exhausting a loop. In practice this can hit exploitable bugs (buffer overflows), but can prevent progress. Allow only one executor that is exhausting a loop, perform aggressive preconditioned symbolic execution.
  \end{itemize}

  \item {\em less covered code}: \cite{EXE-CCS06} uses a mixture of best-first and depth-first search. Best-first approach uses heuristic that give high priority to the path which is blocked at the line that has been executed the fewest number of times. The picked path is executed with DFS for a limited amount of time in order to avoid starvation. 

  \item \cite{KLEE-OSDI08} interleaves in a round robin fashion these strategies:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item {\em random path selection}: build a binary tree structure of all the state (each state is always created due to a fork from a parent). Assign same probability of being executed among states of the same subtree. Avoid starvation by given priority to states high in the tree.
    \item {\em coverage optimize search}: assign weights based on how much new code has been covered by a path. Pick up state randomly using weights as probability.
  \end{itemize}
  Each state is executed only for a time slice defined both as maximum number of instructions and as maximum amount of time.

  \item \cite{SAGE-NDSS08}:

  \item \cite{MAYHEM-SP12} same heuristics as~\cite{SAGE-NDSS08} and~\cite{KLEE-OSDI08}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item executors exploring new code have high priority
    \item executors that identify symbolic memory accesses have high priority
    \item executors where symbolic instruction pointers are detected have high priority
  \end{itemize}

  \item \cite{CS-CACM13} mentions that a {\em fitness function} can be used to drive exploration of input space. Some examples: \cite{BHH-ASE11,LMH-JSS10}.

  \item Priority-based selection in~\cite{CKC-TOCS12}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item bread-first search
      \item depth-first search
      \item max coverage heuristic
      \item path killer heuristic: kill paths that are no longer of interest (e.g., kill path that repeats sequence of program counters more than $n$ times)
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Preconditioned symbolic execution}
\label{precontioned-symbolic-execution}

\cite{AEG-NDSS11} has proposed {\em preconditional symbolic execution} as a novel method to target symbolic execution towards certain subsets of the input state space. The state space subset is determined by the precondition predicate $\Pi_{prec}$: inputs that do not satisfy $\Pi_{prec}$ will not be explored. The intuition for preconditioned symbolic execution is that we can narrow down the state space we are exploring by specifying exploitability conditions as a precondition, e.g., all symbolic inputs should have the maximum size to trigger buffer overflow bugs. The main benefit from preconditioned symbolic execution is simple: by limiting the size of the input state space before symbolic execution begins, we can prune program paths and therefore explore the target program more efficiently.
Note that preconditions cannot be selected at random. If a precondition is too specific, we will detect no bugs or exploits; if it is too general, we will have to explore almost the entire state space. %Thus, preconditions have to describe common characteristics among exploits (to capture as many as possible) and at the same time it should eliminate a significant portion of non-exploitable inputs.\\

Preconditioned symbolic execution enforces the precondition by adding the precondition constraints to the path predicate during initialization. Adding constraints may seem strange since there are more checks to perform at branch points during symbolic execution. However, the shrinking of the state space -- imposed by the precondition constraints -- outweighs the decision procedure overhead at branching points. When the precondition for a branch is unsatisfiable, we do no further checks and do not fork off an interpreter at all for the branch.% We note that while we focus only on exploitable paths, the overall technique is more generally applicable.\\

\paragraph{Preconditions} Kinds of preconditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em None}. There is no precondition and the state space is explored as normal.
\item {\em Known Length}. The precondition is that inputs are of known maximum length, e.g., a network packet has a fixed size.
%Static analysis techniques can be used to automatically determine this precondition.
\item {\em Known Prefix}. The precondition is that the symbolic inputs have a known prefix, e.g., a fixed header string such as the initial {\em magic code} of a binary input file, or a network packet header.
\item {\em Fully Known}. 
%Concolic execution [24] can be viewed as a specific form of preconditioned symbolic execution where the precondition is specified by 
 %a single program path as realized by 
%a concrete example input. For instance, we may already have an input that crashes the program, and we use it as a precondition to determine if the executed path is exploitable. %See Section~\ref{concolic-execution} for a more detailed discussion of this technique.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{An example} Consider the example\mynote{citation to example source, if any?}:

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{small}
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
    // N symbolic branches 
    if (input[0] < 42) [...]
    [...]
    if (input[N - 1] < 42) [...]

    // symbolic loop
    strcpy(dest, input); 

    // M symbolic branches
    if (input[N + 1] < 42) [...]
    [...]
    if (input[N + M - 1] < 42) [...]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{small}
\caption{State space size.}
\label{fig:state-space-size}
\end{figure}

where {\tt input} is an array of $S\ge N+M$ bytes. Impact of preconditions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\em None}. No constraint is added. State space size is $2^N \cdot S \cdot 2^M$.
  \item {\em Known Length}. For instance, we add constraint that $(S - 1)$ bytes of {\tt input} are not equal to \textbackslash0. Since the symbolic loop is known, then the state space size is reduced to $2^N \cdot 2^M$.
  \item {\em Known Prefix}. For instance, we add constraint that the $P$ bytes of {\tt input} are known ($P < N < S$). Since first $P$ branches and first $P$ iterations are concrete, then state space is $S \cdot 2^{N-P} \cdot 2^M$.
  \item {\em Concolic Execution}. We decide the exact values for all bytes of {\tt input}. The state space size is $1$.
\end{itemize}

%\subsection{Dynamic symbolic execution}

%Dynamic symbolic execution refers to a body of techniques that exploit execution with concrete values to explore [...].

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Under-constrained symbolic execution} 
\label{under-constrinained}

By isolating a function from the rest of the program, we can perform symbolic execution on it. The results from this analysis can be exploited when any other program is symbolically executed and a call to the function is present. However, detected errors in the isolated function may be false positives since some of the input values may never been valid when the function is actually executed in the context of the full program. Some prior works (e.g., \cite{CS-ICSE05}\mynote{check this paper}) first analyze code in isolation and then test the generated crashing inputs using concrete executions. 

{\em Under-constrained symbolic execution}~\cite{ED-ISSTA07} is a technique that performs symbolic execution of an isolated function but clearly marks which symbols are {\em under-constrained} to distinguish them from the {\em exactly-constrained} symbols.

Errors due to concrete values and exactly-constrained symbols are treated as true positives. Errors due to under-constrained are treated as true positives only if {\em all} solutions to the currently known constraints on the symbols cause the error to occur. Otherwise the negation of the error is added to the constraint set and the symbolic execution of the isolated function is continued. In other words, an error is reported if and only if it is {\em context-insensitive}. Notice that a symbol may initially be under-constrained and then become exactly constrained. For instance, consider the following piece of code:

    \begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
    assert(a != 0); // no knowledge about this variable
    a = 0;          // from now on we know the value of a
    assert(a != 0); // we always hit this error: context-insensitive! 
    \end{lstlisting}

The first {\tt assert} will not trigger an error: indeed, there is at least one possible value for the symbol associated to {\tt a} that does not hit the error. Conversely, the second {\tt assert} will always trigger an error since {\tt a} has a concrete value and it's not under-constrained anymore.\\

Although this technique is not able to find {\em all} the possible errors in a function, it still can find interesting bugs. Moreover, since symbolically executing a full program may be unfeasible, this technique can make it feasible to test tons of line of code in a reasonable amount of time. In particular, this technique allows an engine to skip code: if a function or any other construct (e.g., a loop) may be troublesome for symbolic execution, it can be skipped by just marking the locations affected by it as under-constrained. However, a possible implementation issue is given by the propagation of under-constrained symbols: given the line of code {\tt if (s < t)}, if {\tt t} is under-constrained while {\tt s} is exactly constrained then when the symbolic execution is proceeded into the two possible branches, {\tt s} must be marked as under-constrained. Some optimization may be needed in order to minimize this propagation effect.

\paragraph{Under-constrained KLEE}\mynote{I will revise this (emilio)} In~\cite{UCKLEE-USEC15}, KLEE~\cite{KLEE-OSDI08} has been extended in order to support under-constrained symbolic execution . In particular, these are some of the main improvements:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\em Lazy initialization.} Whenever there is a pointer that is not concrete and without any active constraint (i.e., it is unbound), its value is checked against {\tt NULL} then two path are analyzed: (a) where the pointer is {\tt NULL} and (b) where the pointer is pointing to a freshly allocated block of memory, whose content is marked as unbound.This means that pointer aliasing is assumed to not occur. In both paths, the pointer is not longer unbound.  In path (b), any test against the pointer is known and dereferences will be successfully resolved. Lazy initialization is common for data structure and thus it is common to bound its maximum length (i.e., {\em k-bounding}) in order to prevent the engine from allocating an unbounded number of objects.
  \item {\em Patch checking.} The main goal of~\cite{UCKLEE-USEC15} is to detect if a patch has introduced new bugs. In order to do so, it symbolically executes two compiled versions of a function: $P$, the unpatched version, and $P'$, the patched version. If it finds any execution paths along which $P'$ crashes but $P$ does not (when given the same symbolic inputs), it reports a potential bug. Indeed, due to missing input preconditions, not all crashes are real bugs: if both $P$ and $P'$ crash on an input, then maybe the crash is given by the unknown preconditions. 
  \item {\em Pruning techniques.} Using a static cross-checker (that navigates the control-flow graph and marks differing basic block between $P$ and $P'$), \cite{UCKLEE-USEC15} prunes paths that have never executed a differing basic block and that cannot reach a differing basic block from their current program counter and call stack. Moreover, $P'$ is executed before executing $P$, allowing the system to prune paths that return from $P'$ without triggering an error, or that trigger an error without reaching different blocks.
  \item {Dealing with false positives.} Two approaches are pursued to limit false positives:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item {\em manual annotations}: examples are data types invariants or preconditions upon function calls.
      \item {\em automated heuristics}: {\em must-fail} heuristics identify errors that must occur for all input values following that execution path. For instance, {\em belief-fail} heuristic checks if a function contradicts itself (e.g., a code checks that a pointer is {\tt NULL} and then dereferences it). Another variation of must-fail heuristic is {\em concrete-fail} that an assertion failure or memory errors was triggered by a concrete condition or pointer.
    \end{itemize}
  \item {\em Rule-based checkers.} Several rule-based checkers have been built on top of UCKLEE. They do a similar job such as other dynamic tools (e.g., {\em memcheck} for memory leaks and uninitialized data) but reasoning on all possible paths, not just the concrete ones. Moreover, user inputs can be considered as fully constrained (i.e., no assumption is valid on it since the code should sanitize it). 
  \item {\em Optimizations.} Some optimizations:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Symbolic objects have a symbolic size: whenever there is an access to the object content, the system verifies if the offset could exceed the object's symbolic size. whenever path is considered where the offset does not exceed the symbolic size, then a lower bound on the symbolic size is set.
      \item Some library functions (e.g., {\tt strlen}) have been replaced with variants that do not lead to path explosion
      \item Scores of rules to simplify symbolic expressions
      \item {\em lazy constraints}: defer evaluation of constraints using a solver as much as possible. For instance, if there is an hard constraint on branch, take both branches and if an error is found check if that branch was actually valid.
      \item function pointers should be made concrete by the user.
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{State merging}

Several static program analysis techniques such as abstract interpretation merge states corresponding to different paths into a state that over-approximates them. In a precise symbolic execution, however, merging is not allowed to introduce any approximation or abstraction, and therefore can only change formulas to have them characterize sets of execution paths. In other words, a merged state will be described by a formula that represents the disjunction of the formulas that would described the individual states if they were kept separate.

\paragraph{An example} Let's consider the following piece of code (taken from~\cite{VERITESTING-ICSE14}):\mynote{customize example and improve discussion}
    \begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
    B1: if (x > 1) 
    B2:   y = 42;
    B3: else if (x < 42) 
    B4:    y = 17;
    B5: else ;
    B6: ;
    \end{lstlisting}
Then a symbolic execution engine may perform state merging in the following way:
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \vspace{-3mm}
  \includegraphics[width=0.65\columnwidth]{images/state-merging} 
  \vspace{-3mm}
  %\label{fig:example-symbolic-execution}
\end{figure}
where {\em ite} statements represents {\tt if-then-else} statements and $\bot$ stands for a non-taken branch.

\paragraph{Trade-off} Early work~\cite{G-POPL07,HSS-RV09} has shown that merging techniques effectively decrease the number of paths to explore, but also put a burden on constraints solvers, which typically encounter difficulties when dealing with disjunction. Merging can also introduce new symbolic expressions in the code, for instance when merging different concrete values from a conditional assignment into a symbolic expression over the condition. \cite{KKB-PLDI12} provides an excellent discussion of the design space of state merging techniques. At one end of the spectrum, search-based symbolic execution (as implemented, e.g., in~\cite{KLEE-OSDI08}) does not perform any merge. The other extreme is complete static state merging, implemented by verification condition generators, e.g, ~\cite{SATURN-POPL05,CALYSTO-ICSE08}), that combines states at join points after all the subpaths have been encoded.

\mynote{Function summaries}

\paragraph{Selective state merging} Intermediate merging solutions can adopt heuristics for driving both merging decisions and CFG exploration. Generating larger symbolic expressions and possibly extra solvers invocations can outweigh the benefit of having fewer states, leading to poorer overall performance~\cite{HSS-RV09,KKB-PLDI12}. Moreover, in order to maximize the opportunities for merging a symbolic execution engine should traverse the CFG in a topological order, which denies search exploration strategies aiming at prioritizing more ``interesting'' states over others.

Recent works (e.g., \cite{KKB-PLDI12} and \cite{VERITESTING-ICSE14}) have introduced novel techniques to tackle these issues: 
\begin{itemize}

  \item {\em query count estimation} identifies state merges that can reduce exploration time. This technique relies on a simple form of static analysis to identify how often each variable is used in branch conditions past any given point in the CFG. The estimate is used as a proxy for the number of solver queries that a given variable is likely to be part of. When two states are sufficiently similar, the overhead from solving more complex queries is likely to be outweighed by the savings from exploring fewer paths.

  \item {\em dynamic state merging} efficiently combines static state merging with common search heuristics. This technique allows merging of states that do not share the same program location. This is useful, for instance, for unbounded loops for which search-based symbolic execution engines would employ search strategies that prioritize exploring new code over unrolling, while static state merging would require a depth-first exploration and thus fully unroll the possibly infinitely many iterations of the loop. Dynamic state merging can consider for merging states that are likely to become similar in a small number of execution steps: this is likely to happen if one state is similar to one of the predecessors of the other. The intuition behind the algorithm is that if two states are similar, then also their two respective successors are likely to be similar after a few steps.

  \item {\em veritesting} dynamically identifies set of statements that generate formulas which are easy for solvers. Using a dynamically recovered CFG, it detects pieces of code that do not contain system calls, indirect jumps, or other statements that are difficult to precisely reason about statically. In particular, frontiers of hard-to-analyze statements are identified. Easy to analyze set of statements are then analyzed maintaining a single formula that describe all the merged states, while hard to analyze set of statements are evaluated using separate states pursuing the traditional symbolic execution approach.

\end{itemize}

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Abstraction}

Abstraction~\cite{C-SEFM07} is a technique that may be used for computing {\em under-approximations} or {\em over-approximations} of a program state. This approach has been exploited in prior works~\cite{APV-SPIN06,VPP-ISSTA06,XGM-ISSTA08}\mynote{check these papers}. Since some of these works reason about state subsumption, they may be connected with the incremental solving optimization discussed in Section~\ref{constraint-optimizations}.


% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Limiting state space through other program analysis techniques}

Other static or dynamic techniques can be used to help a symbolic engine to focus on interesting states:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\em program slicing}
  \item {\em taint-analysis}
  \item {\em source code analysis}: extraction of input properties (e.g., size or contents of an array)
  \item {\em phi-node folding transformation}: add select operations to merge statically paths (see, e.g., \cite{CCK-EUROSYS11})
  \item {\em compositional techniques}: caching and reusing the analysis of lower-level function in subsequent computations. The main idea is to compute function summaries. See, e.g.,~\cite{G-POPL07,G-PLDI11,MS-TR07}.
\end{itemize}
