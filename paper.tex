\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Many security and software testing applications require checking whether certain properties of a program hold for any possible usage scenario. For instance, a tool for vulnerability identification may need to rule out the existence of any backdoor to bypass a program's authentication. Random testing techniques typically fail at identifying such vulnerabilities, as a backdoor may only be hit for very specific program workloads.

Symbolic execution provides an elegant solution for a systematic exploration of the input space, by analyzing many possible execution paths at the same time. Rather than taking on fully specified input values, the technique abstractly represents them as symbols, resorting to constraint solvers to construct actual instances that would cause property violations. Symbolic execution has been incubated in dozens of tools developed over the last four decades, leading to major practical breakthroughs in a number of prominent software reliability applications.

In this paper we discuss the main ideas behind a symbolic executor and the scalability problems it typically encounters. We also describe the issues that arise when analyzing an application available only in binary form, and present prominent usage examples of symbolic execution in software testing and computer security applications.

\section{Misc}
\label{se:misc}

The references list is condensed. The default bibliography styles, such as \texttt{plain}, \texttt{abbrv}, and \texttt{alpha}, are suggested.

Page numbers are at the bottom of every page. Authors must leave the page numbers in as-is. When EasyChair proceedings and Procedia volumes are processed by EasyChair, the correct volume page numbers will be inserted automatically.

Paragraph headings should not be capitalized and should have a trailing period. 

References must be provided in a {\tt .bib} file, so that \BibTeX\ can be used to generate the references in a consistent style in a volume. The preferred styles are {\tt plain} and {\tt alpha}.

\section{Appendix}
\label{se:appendix}

\noindent Depending on the specific context in which symbolic execution is used, different choices and assumptions are made to address the questions highlighted above. Although these choices typically affect soundness or completeness, in several scenarios a partial exploration of the space of possible execution states may be sufficient to achieve the goal (e.g., identifying a crashing input for an application) within a limited time budget.
