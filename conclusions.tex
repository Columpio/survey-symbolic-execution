\section{Conclusions}
\label{se:conclusions}

Techniques for symbolic execution have evolved significantly in the last decade, leading to major practical breakthroughs. In 2016, DARPA has challenged the global innovation community with a \$2M prize to build a computer that can hack and patch unknown software with no one at the keyboard. The winner, {\sc Mayhem}~\cite{MAYHEM-SP12}, was also the first autonomous computer system to play the Capture-The-Flag contest at the DEF CON 24 hacker convention\footnote{\url{https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-24/dc-24-ctf.html}.}. The event demonstrated that tools for automatic exploit detection based on symbolic execution can be competitive with human experts, paving the road to unprecedented applications and the rise of start-ups that have the potential to shape software security and reliability the next decades.
