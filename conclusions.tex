\section{Conclusions}
\label{se:conclusions}

Techniques for symbolic execution have evolved significantly in the last decade, leading to major practical breakthroughs. As recently demonstrated at the DEF CON 2016 hacker convention, tools for automatic exploit detection based on symbolic execution have proven themselves to be competitive with human experts, paving the road to unprecedented applications and the rise of start-ups that will shape software reliability the next decades.
